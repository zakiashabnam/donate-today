            <p>Many of us are donating food to help families in need. Several of my clients have asked for advice on the
                types of non-perishable items they should buy. One common theme was what to pick up other than pasta and

                villages across five districts. Flooded latrines have contaminated wells and other water supplies,
                depriving children and their families of access to clean water.</p>
